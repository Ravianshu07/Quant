# Quant
👋 Hey there! Welcome to my Data Science Projects

This repo is my little corner of the internet where I explore data, build models, break stuff, and (sometimes) make things work again 😄.

I'm Ravi, and I created this space to put together everything I'm learning and building in data science, especially around finance and analytics. Whether you're here out of curiosity, to borrow code, or just randomly clicked — welcome!

## 🧠 What you'll find here

This isn't one of those "Hello World" repos. Everything here is something I genuinely enjoyed working on. Here's a quick overview of the kinds of things I’ve been up to:

- 📈 **Stock Price Prediction** – Simulating Tesla’s price using stochastic models  
- 💸 **Portfolio Optimization** – Trying to beat the market (or at least not get rekt)  
- 📊 **Factor Investing** – Using CAPM and Fama-French models to explain returns  
- 🏃‍♂️ **High-Frequency Trading Simulations** – Fast-paced and nerdy  
- 🛍️ **RFM Segmentation** – Because marketing data deserves love too  
- 📉 **Crash Detection** – Visualizing market meltdowns

## 🗂️ Datasets

Most of the data is either scraped, simulated, or downloaded from public sources like Yahoo Finance, Kaggle, or academic datasets. Some filenames you’ll see:
- `tesla.csv`
- `nifty50_closing_prices.csv`
